# Character Engine
### ðŸ”§[In active development] 
Universal frontend for the various LLM APIs in the form of Discord bot.
For now, works only with **CharacterAI** and **OpenAI**, but the list will be extended soon.

## ðŸª„Features
- Supports all Tavern-like character cards
- Allows to spawn up to 15 characters *(Discord webhooks limit)* in a single channel
- Embedded character finder based on [CharacterHub](https://www.chub.ai/) catalog and **c.ai**'s personal search
- Per-character flexible configuration allowing to set personal jailbreak prompts, message format templates, API backends and much more **for every character on a server separately**
- Supports answers swiping
- Filter "tails" for **c.ai** - view the content of messages that were filtered and deleted (only the part that was written **before** the message was deleted, **it doesn't actually bypass the filter, but may be useful sometimes**)
- *more soon*
